# Machine Learning for Diagnosing Type II Diabetes

This project uses machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of Type II diabetes based on health and lifestyle indicators. The data comes from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

## 🧠 Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies whether an individual is likely to have Type II diabetes based on a set of features including:

- Age  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- General Health  
- High Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol Level  
- Difficulty Walking  
- And other health indicators

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is derived from the CDC's BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System), which collects self-reported health-related information across the United States.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📁 Files Included

- `diabetes_model.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full model development process.
- `presentation.pdf`: Project summary presentation.

## 📈 Model(s) Used

- Logistic Regression  
- DummyClassifier (baseline)  
- Feature selection and preprocessing techniques were applied to improve accuracy.

## 📌 Conclusions

The project shows how interpretable models like logistic regression can be effective in predicting diabetes risk using basic health and lifestyle data.
